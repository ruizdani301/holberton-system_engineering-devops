A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure,
a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP
stack.
On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure
that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com.
Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your
website.

<ul>What is a server</li>
server within a web infrastructure, is a computer capable
of handling a client's request and responding accordingly

<ul>What is the role of the domain name</li>
Allows the translation of a name to an IP address (Internet Protocol Address). Exemple www.coquito.com  to 192.168.4.25

<ulWhat type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com</li>
www.foobar.com uses an A record. This can be checked by running dig www.foobar.com.
Note: the results might be different but for the infrastructure in this design, an A record is used.
Address Mapping record (A Record)â€”also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.

<ulWhat is the role of the web server</li>
The main function of a web server is to store and transmit the requested content of a website to the user's browser.

<ulWhat is the role of the application server.</li>
Application servers are server programs on a distributed network that provide the execution environment
for an application program. More specifically, the application server is the main runtime component in all
setups and where an application actually runs. The application server collaborates with the web server to provide
a dynamic and personalized response to a client request.

<ulWhat is the role of the database.</li>
A database (database) stores data and connects it in a logical unit together with the metadata necessary for its
processing. Databases are very useful instruments for managing large files and facilitating the consultation of information.

<ulWhat is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website.</li>
The server uses the http protocol to communicate with the computer requesting the service
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
<ul>SPOF</li>
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

<ul>Cannot scale if there's too much incoming traffic.</li>
It would be hard to scale this infrastructure because one server contains the required components. The server can quickly
run out of resources or slow down when it starts receiving a lot of requests.

<li>if the MySQL database server was down, the entire website would be down.</li>
Since there is only one server, if maintenance is required, there will most likely be no service, leading to downtime.
</ul>
